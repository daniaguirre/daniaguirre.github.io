<p>An automorphism of a graph <script type="math/tex">G=(V,E)</script> is a bijective map <script type="math/tex">\pi:V \to V</script> that preserves adjacency, i.e. 
if <script type="math/tex">(v_1,v_2)\in E</script> then <script type="math/tex">(\pi(v_1),\pi(v_2))\in E</script>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1.</strong> <em>An automorphism of the square graph defined by the permutation <script type="math/tex">\sigma=(1,2,3,4)</script>.</em></p>

<p>An automorphism of a graph <script type="math/tex">G=(V,E)</script> can be seen as a permutation over its set of vertices <script type="math/tex">V</script>.
The <strong>Example 1</strong> shows an automorphism of the square graph, which is denoted by the permuation <script type="math/tex">\sigma=(1,2,3,4)</script> (in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Cycle_notation" target="_blank">cycle notation</a>). 
Notice that <script type="math/tex">\sigma^2=(1,3)(2,4)</script>, <script type="math/tex">\sigma^3=(1,4,3,2)</script> and <script type="math/tex">\sigma^4=(1)(2)(3)(4)</script> are also automorphisms of the square graph.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/aut_ex2_map.png" alt="automorphisms" /></p>

<p><strong>Example 2.</strong> <em>The automorphisms of the square graph defined by the permutations <script type="math/tex">\sigma^2</script>, <script type="math/tex">\sigma^3</script> and <script type="math/tex">\sigma^4</script>.</em></p>

<p>Here, we have two interesting questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do all graphs have any automorphism?</li>
  <li>What is the maximum number of automorphisms that a graph can have?</li>
</ol>

<p>The answer of the first question is <em>yes</em>, all graphs have at least the <code class="highlighter-rouge">trivial automorphism</code>, denoted by <script type="math/tex">\varepsilon</script>, 
that maps each vertex to itself. As we can see in the <strong>Example 2</strong>, <script type="math/tex">\varepsilon=\sigma^4</script>. 
Turning now to the second question, since an automorphism is defined by a permutation over <script type="math/tex">|V|</script>, 
then a graph has at most <script type="math/tex">|V|!</script> automorphisms, it is the number of permutations over <script type="math/tex">V</script>. 
For instance, the set of automorphisms of the square graph  is <script type="math/tex">Aut(G)=\{\varepsilon, \sigma, \sigma^2, \sigma^3, \rho, \tau\}</script>, where <script type="math/tex">\rho=(2,4)</script> and <script type="math/tex">\tau=(1,3)</script>.
In particular, for the complete graph of <script type="math/tex">n</script> vertices, i.e. <script type="math/tex">K_n</script>, any permutation over <script type="math/tex">V</script> define an automorphism, for instance <script type="math/tex">|Aut(K_3)|!=3!=6</script>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3.</strong> <em>The complete graph <script type="math/tex">K_3</script> and <script type="math/tex">Aut(K_3)=\{\sigma,\sigma^2,\sigma^3,\rho,\tau,\phi\}</script> where <script type="math/tex">\sigma=(1,2,3)</script>, <script type="math/tex">\rho=(1,3)</script>, <script type="math/tex">\tau=(2,1)</script>, <script type="math/tex">\phi=(3,2)</script>.</em></p>

<p>Lectors familiarized with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)" target="_blank">algebraic groups</a> can see that 
<script type="math/tex">Aut(G)</script> has a group structure with respect to the composition of functions, where <script type="math/tex">\varepsilon</script> is the identity element.
In fact, <script type="math/tex">Aut(G)</script> is a subgroup of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_group" target="_blank">symmetric group</a> 
which consists of the set of all permutations of a set.</p>

<h2 id="vertex-transitive-graphs">Vertex-transitive Graphs</h2>

<p>A graph <script type="math/tex">G=(V,E)</script> is vertex-transitive if there is an automorphims between any two of its vertices, i.e. 
for all <script type="math/tex">u,v \in V</script>, there exists <script type="math/tex">\pi \in Aut(G)</script> such that <script type="math/tex">\pi(u)=v</script>. Notice that the graph of <strong>Example 1</strong> is vertex-transitive.
Now, look at the graph of <strong>Example 4</strong>, is it vertex-transitive?.</p>

<p><strong>Example 4.</strong> <em>The 3-path graph with the automorphism <script type="math/tex">\sigma = (1,3)</script> and <script type="math/tex">Aut(G)=\{\varepsilon, \sigma\}</script></em></p>

<p>Roughly speaking, all vertices in a vertex-transive graph have the same <em>‚Äúgraph perpective‚Äù</em>. 
In <strong>Example 4</strong>, vertices <script type="math/tex">1</script> and <script type="math/tex">3</script> are the end points of the 3-path, then they have the same <em>‚Äúgraph perpective‚Äù</em>. 
In fact, <script type="math/tex">\sigma</script> defines an automorphism between these vertices.
By the other hand, the vertex <script type="math/tex">2</script> is an internal vertex of the 3-path, then it has a different <em>‚Äúgraph perpective‚Äù</em> 
and it is not possible define automorphism over the 3-path that maps the vertex <script type="math/tex">2</script> to the vertex <script type="math/tex">1</script> or <script type="math/tex">3</script>.
Therefore, the 3-path is not vertex-transitive.</p>

<p>In general, all vertex-transitive graph are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_graph" target="_blank">regular</a> but not all regular graphs are vertex-transitive.</p>

<h2 id="edge-transitive-graphs">Edge-transitive Graphs</h2>

<p>A graph <script type="math/tex">G=(V,E)</script> is edge-transitive if there is an automorphism between any two edges, i.e. 
for all <script type="math/tex">(u,v), (w,x) \in E</script>, there exists <script type="math/tex">\pi \in Aut(G)</script> such that <script type="math/tex">(\pi(u),\pi(v)) = (w,x)</script> or <script type="math/tex">(\pi(u),\pi(v)) = (x,w)</script>.</p>

<p>From <strong>Example 4</strong>, <script type="math/tex">E=\{(1,2),(2,3)\}</script> and  <script type="math/tex">(\sigma(1),\sigma(2))=(3,2), (\sigma(3),\sigma(2))=(1,2)\in E</script>,
therefore the 3-path graph is edge-transitive. Following a similiar approach it can be showed that
the square graph (see <strong>Example 1</strong>) is also edge-transitive.</p>

<p><strong>Example 5.</strong> <em>A graph with the automorphisms <script type="math/tex">\sigma = (1,2,3,4,5)(6,7,8,9,10)</script>, <script type="math/tex">\rho=(1,6)(2,7)(3,8)(4,9)(5,10)</script>, 
<script type="math/tex">\tau=(2,5)(3,4)(7,10)(8,9)</script> and <script type="math/tex">Aut(G)=\{\varepsilon, \sigma^i, \sigma^i\rho, \rho, \tau\}</script></em> for <script type="math/tex">1\leq i \leq 5</script>.</p>

<p>Let see if the graph <script type="math/tex">G=(V,E)</script> of <strong>Example 5</strong> is edge-transitive. Let <script type="math/tex">E_1</script>, <script type="math/tex">E_2</script> and <script type="math/tex">E_3</script> be subsets of <script type="math/tex">E</script>, such that 
<script type="math/tex">E=E_1\cup E_2 \cup E_3</script> where <script type="math/tex">E_1=\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,1)\}</script>, <script type="math/tex">E_2=\{(6,7),(7,8),(8,9),(9,10)\}</script> and
<script type="math/tex">E_3=\{(1,6),(2,7),(3,8),(4,9),(5,10)\}</script>. We have that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><script type="math/tex">\sigma^i\rho</script> defines an automorphism from edges in <script type="math/tex">E_1</script> to edges in <script type="math/tex">E_2</script>, 
e.g. <script type="math/tex">(1,2)\in E_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">(\sigma(\rho(1)),\sigma( \rho (2)))=(\sigma(6),\sigma(7))=(7,8)\in E_2</script>.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">\sigma^i</script> defines an automorphism between edges in <script type="math/tex">E_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">E_2</script>, 
e.g. <script type="math/tex">(3,4)\in E_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">(\sigma(3),\sigma(4))=(4,5)\in E_1</script>. Similarly, <script type="math/tex">(7,8)\in E_2</script> and <script type="math/tex">(\sigma^2(7),\sigma^2(8))=(9,10)\in E_2</script>.</li>
  <li><script type="math/tex">\tau</script> defines an automorphism between edges in <script type="math/tex">E_3</script>. 
e.g. <script type="math/tex">(2,7)\in E_3</script>, <script type="math/tex">(\tau(2),\tau(7))=(5,10)\in E_3</script>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since edges in <script type="math/tex">E_3</script> are part of two cycles of length 4 and edges in 
<script type="math/tex">E_1 \cup E_2</script> are part of two cycles of length 4 and 5, then it is not possible define an automorphism between them.
Therefore, the graph of <strong>Example 5</strong> is not edge-transitive. 
Intuitively, it means that edges in sets <script type="math/tex">E_1 \cup E_2</script> and <script type="math/tex">E_3</script> have a different <em>‚Äúgraph perpectives‚Äù</em>.
In contrast, this graph is vertex-transitive, note that all nodes are part of two cycles of length 4 and 5, 
then all nodes have the same <em>‚Äúgraph perpective‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>In contrast with vertex-transitive graphs, edge-transitive graphs are not necessarilly regular. 
However, if a graph is regular and edge-transitive, then it is also vertex-transitive.</p>

<h2 id="arc-transtive-graphs">Arc-transtive graphs</h2>

<p>A graph <script type="math/tex">G=(V,E)</script> is arc-transitive (also called <strong>symmetric</strong> or <strong>flag-transitive</strong>) if there is an automorphism between any two edges, i.e. 
for all <script type="math/tex">(u,v), (w,x) \in E</script>, there exists <script type="math/tex">\pi \in Aut(G)</script> such that <script type="math/tex">(\pi(u),\pi(v)) = (w,x)</script> and <script type="math/tex">(\pi(u),\pi(v)) = (x,w)</script>. 
Notice that this condition is stronger that the edge-transitive condition.</p>

<p>For instance, in the 3-path graph (see <strong>Example 4</strong>), edge <script type="math/tex">(1,2)</script> is maped to vertices in edge <script type="math/tex">(2,3)</script> through the permutation 
<script type="math/tex">\sigma =(1,3)</script>, it is <script type="math/tex">(\sigma(1),\sigma(2))=(3,2)</script>. However, there is not automorphism <script type="math/tex">\pi</script> such that
<script type="math/tex">(\sigma(1),\sigma(2))=(2,3)</script>.
Therefore, the 3-path is edge-transitive but not arc-transitive. By the other hand, the square-graph (see <strong>Example 1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>) 
and the 3-complete graph (see <strong>Example 3</strong>) are arc-transitive.</p>

<p>In general, arc-transitive graphs are vertex and edge-transitive, however, there are vertex and edge-transitive graphs
with odd degree that are not arc-transitive. 
These graps are called <strong>semi-simetric</strong> or <strong>half-transitive</strong>. 
The smallest known semi-symmetric graph is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holt_graph" target="_blank">Holt graph</a> discovered by Derek Holt in the seventies.</p>

<h2 id="t-arc-transitive-graphs">t-arc-transitive graphs</h2>

<p>A graph is t-arc-transitive, also called <strong>t-transitive</strong>, if there is an automorphism between any t-arcs but not (t+1)-arcs, i.e. 
for all two t-arcs <script type="math/tex">v_1,v_2,..., v_t</script> and <script type="math/tex">u_1,u_2,...,u_t</script>, there exists <script type="math/tex">\pi \in Aut(G)</script> such that <script type="math/tex">\pi(v_i)= u_i</script> for <script type="math/tex">1\leq i\leq t</script>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 6.</strong> <em>The M√∂bius‚ÄìKantor graph is 2-arc-transitive.</em></p>

<h2 id="distance-transitive-graphs">Distance-transitive graphs</h2>

<p>A graph is distance transitive, if there is an automorphism between any two pair of vertice that are at the same distance, i.e. 
for all <script type="math/tex">v_1,v_2,u_1,u_2\in V</script>, such that <script type="math/tex">d(v_1,v_2)=d(u_1,u_2)</script>, there exists <script type="math/tex">\pi \in Aut(G)</script> such that <script type="math/tex">\pi(v_1)= u_1</script> and <script type="math/tex">\pi(v_2)= u_2</script>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 6.</strong> <em>The Petersen graph is distance transitive.</em></p>
